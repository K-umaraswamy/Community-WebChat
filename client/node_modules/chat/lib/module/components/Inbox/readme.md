# Juice Inbox Component

This react native component is a drop-in for an entire inbox UI.

It directly integrates with Juice's `useInbox` hook.

## Quick example

This example shows a **fully backend-connected**, **real-time** inbox. ðŸ¤¯

```javascript
import * as React from 'react'
import Juice, { useInbox } from 'usechat'

export default function() {
	const [{ data, loading }] = useInbox()
	return <Juice.Inbox rooms={data} onPressItem={id => console.log(id)} />
}
```

You can use it with your own backend if you'd like, since it's fully customizable. This component has a ton of props, so everything is extensible. But it was definitely made with `useInbox` in mind.
